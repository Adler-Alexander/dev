# CCA for Splunk
Ever wished you had a central interface to interact with all aspects of Splunk architecture and administration? 
Let's be honest, running Splunk is all about finding an efficient and scalable way to manage all .conf files and the other magic under the hood. At scale, the complexity often gives way to either speed or quality - if you don't find a way to automate it.

That is precisely what we've done for years, and now it's time to share how you can do it to. Our solution enables a full lifecycle management of Splunk using a **C****ontinuous **C**onfiguration **A**utomation framework powered by Ansible.
The templates that we provide for configuring Splunk roles are used in our own Multisite Cluster implementations. After you have configured your project, the control is in your hands when it comes to deciding your settings. Adding or modifying parameters has no impact on the framework and are localized under your control.

Playbooks are DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), with almost no tasks - instead they are using common code in roles. So an update of a task has just to be done in one place, keeping code updates much cleaner and easier to overview.

# Where does CCA for come from and who supports it?

The framework concept utilized in CCA for Splunk goes back several years and has proven to be absolutely critical in managing complex Splunk infrastructures with 100+ servers in several environments. 450+ tasks has been developed across 10 carefully created Ansible roles. We continuously invest **hundreds of development hours for every release**, so that you can get the scalability that you should expect out of a automation framework.
Besides adding your servers to the ansible inventory file, there is less than 25 parameters that you have to set per environment - then off you go to much different Splunk journey going forward.

This is the free open source version of this automation framework, a trickledown version from our premium option but with all features needed to administrate any size of Splunk environment.
