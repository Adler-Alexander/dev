# CCA for Splunk

Ever wished you had a central interface to interact with all aspects of Splunk architecture and administration? Let's be honest, running Splunk is all about finding an efficient and scalable way to manage all .conf files and the other magic under the hood. At scale, the complexity often gives way to either speed or quality - if you don't find a way to automate it.

That is precisely what we've done for years, and now it's time to share how you can do it to. Our solution enables a full lifecycle management of Splunk using a Continuous Configuration Automation framework powered by Ansible.

See how you can manage certificates, upgrades & app deployments with full control and flexibility.

You can find the Project Presentation as well as a Q&A section in the [Wiki](https://github.com/innovationfleet/cca_for_splunk/wiki).
